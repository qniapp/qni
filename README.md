# Qni

Welcome to the [Qni](https://qniapp.net) repository. Qni is a quantum computer simulator that runs in your browser.

Qni is largely inspired by Craig Gidney's [Quirk](https://github.com/Strilanc/Quirk), a pioneer in quantum circuit simulators. Qni inherits Quirk's features, such as live programming of quantum circuits and circuit bookmarks, and extends them based on modern web technologies such as CSS responsive design and Web Components standards. This makes it possible to enjoy quantum circuit programming on smartphones and embed "live" quantum circuits in any web page.

## Contents

This repository is a monorepo containing three packages:

- [**packages/common**](https://github.com/qniapp/qni/tree/main/packages/common) contains the source for the [@qni/common](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@qni/common) package. This is a common library used by other Qni packages.
- [**packages/simulator**](https://github.com/qniapp/qni/tree/main/packages/simulator) contains the source for the [@qni/simulator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@qni/simulator) package. This is a quantum computer simulator implementation in TypeScript. It is usually called by the browser's ServiceWorker thread and runs asynchronously.
- [**packages/elements**](https://github.com/qniapp/qni/tree/main/packages/elements) contains the source for the [@qni/elements](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@qni/elements) package. This is a custom web component library for rendering quantum circuits. It is used by `@qni/www` as well as several other projects.

And two apps:

- [**apps/www**](https://github.com/qniapp/qni/tree/main/apps/www) contains the source for the [qniapp.net](https://qniapp.net) website.
- [**apps/tutorial**](https://github.com/qniapp/qni/tree/main/apps/tutorial) contains the source for the [qniapp.github.io/qni](https://qniapp.github.io/qni/) website.

And one example:

- [**examples/elements-example**](https://github.com/qniapp/qni/tree/main/examples/elements-example) is a simple example for `@qni/elements`.
